# AB_PhaseTransition

Repository of modules and codes developed for studying the AB phase transition in superfluid Helium-3, developed in collaboration with GitHub user timohyva. It started as a fork of https://github.com/timohyva/AB_PhaseTransition/.


## Descriptions 

The main modules of the repository are
- he3_tools: basic module containing functions for string-coupling corrected bulk free energy
- he3_wall: extends with gradient energy and code for solution of 1D GL static differential equations
- he3_temp_scales: tests functionality for switching between temperature scales, plotting phase diagram
- he3_sc_corrs: tests strong-coupling corrections in the literature
- he3_free_energy_landscape: plotting slices of the bulk free energy between arbitrary points in order parameter space
- random_ics: dynamical evolution of random initial conditions in 1D
- he3_bubble (not updated): for static bubble solutions mediating AB transition
